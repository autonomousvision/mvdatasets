# DataSets

Various data loaders for multi-view datasets commonly used in 3D reconstruction and view-synthesis:
- [DTU]
- [NeRF-Synthetic]

Soon to be supported:
- [NeRF-LLFF]
- [NeRF-360]

## Misc:
    This code uses an "OpenCV" style camera coordinate system, where the Y-axis points downwards (the up-vector points in the negative Y-direction), the X-axis points right, and the Z-axis points into the image plane.
